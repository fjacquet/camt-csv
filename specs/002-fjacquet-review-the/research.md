# Research Findings: Codebase Improvements

**Date**: mardi 14 octobre 2025

## Performance Goals

**Decision**: No specific performance goals are defined for this feature in the current `spec.md`.
**Rationale**: The primary focus of this feature is on maintainability, extensibility, error handling, and testability rather than raw performance optimization. The proposed changes (Parser Factory, custom errors, interface-driven categorization, standardized logging) are not expected to introduce significant performance overhead.
**Alternatives considered**: N/A. Performance goals could be defined in a future iteration if profiling indicates bottlenecks or if new requirements emerge that necessitate specific performance targets.

## Constraints

**Decision**: No specific technical or operational constraints (e.g., memory limits, specific hardware, offline capability) are defined for this feature in the current `spec.md`.
**Rationale**: The feature primarily involves refactoring and architectural improvements within the existing Go CLI application. Existing project constraints (e.g., Go runtime environment, file system access) are assumed to apply.
**Alternatives considered**: N/A. Constraints could be defined in a future iteration if the feature scope expands to include new deployment environments or stricter operational requirements.
