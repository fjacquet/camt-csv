# Implementation Plan: Review Codebase for Constitution Compliance

**Branch**: `001-review-the-codebase` | **Date**: 2025-10-12 | **Spec**: /specs/001-review-the-codebase/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-review-the-codebase/spec.md`

## Summary

The primary goal is to develop an automated tool that systematically reviews the codebase against the project constitution. This tool will identify areas of non-compliance, process multiple constitution files, integrate with Git for tracking changes, and generate structured reports (JSON/XML) to facilitate corrective actions.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Go 1.22+
**Primary Dependencies**: spf13/cobra, spf13/viper, github.com/sirupsen/logrus, gopkg.in/yaml.v3
**Storage**: Files (for constitution definitions and generated reports)
**Testing**: go test, github.com/stretchr/testify
**Target Platform**: Linux server
**Project Type**: Single (CLI tool)
**Performance Goals**: No specific performance targets are required at this stage.
**Constraints**: Integration with Git for tracking changes and pull requests, ability to process multiple constitution files.
**Scale/Scope**: Review of entire files or directories within the codebase.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Clear, Idiomatic Go**: **PASS**. All code will adhere to Go best practices.
- **II. Robust Error Handling**: **PASS**. Errors will be checked and propagated, with custom error types where appropriate.
- **III. Comprehensive Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: **PASS**. Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests will be implemented with high coverage.
- **IV. Explicit Concurrency Management**: **N/A for initial phase**. Not explicitly required by the current spec, but will be considered for future performance optimizations if needed for large codebases.
- **V. CLI Best Practices**: **PASS**. `spf13/cobra` and `spf13/viper` will be used for CLI and configuration, adhering to standard practices.
- **VI. Interface-Driven Design**: **PASS**. A `ComplianceReviewer` or similar interface will be defined for extensibility.
- **VII. Single Responsibility Principle**: **PASS**. Components will be designed with clear, single responsibilities (e.g., `CodebaseScanner`, `PrincipleEvaluator`, `ReportGenerator`).
- **VIII. Immutability by Default**: **PASS**. Core data models (e.g., `ConstitutionPrinciple`, `ComplianceReport`) will be immutable.
- **IX. Hybrid Categorization**: **N/A**. This principle is not applicable to the codebase review feature.
- **X. Configuration Management**: **PASS**. `spf13/viper` will be used for hierarchical configuration, including loading multiple constitution files.

**Code Quality & Style**: **PASS**. Godoc comments, structured logging with `logrus`, and `golangci-lint` will be enforced.
**Dependency Management**: **PASS**. Go Modules will be used with pinned versions.
**Design Patterns**: **PASS**. Appropriate design patterns (e.g., Strategy for different principle evaluation methods) will be applied.
**Performance & Resource Management**: **N/A for initial phase**. No specific performance targets are required at this stage, but efficient resource management will be considered.
**Security**: **PASS**. All user input (flags, arguments, config values) will be validated. Sensitive data will be handled securely, and appropriate file permissions will be enforced for generated reports/config.
**Monitoring & Observability**: **PASS**. Structured logging will be used for all significant operations. Application metrics (e.g., Prometheus) and health checks will be implemented.
**Deployment & Release**: **PASS**. Semantic Versioning and automated CI/CD will be considered for future releases.
**Governance**: **PASS**. All changes will adhere to the project's governance principles.

**Structure Decision**: The project will follow a single project structure, typical for a CLI tool, with clear separation of models, services, CLI logic, and shared libraries. Tests will be organized into unit, integration, and contract categories.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
