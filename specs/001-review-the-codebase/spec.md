# Feature Specification: Review Codebase for Constitution Compliance

**Feature Branch**: `001-review-the-codebase`  
**Created**: 2025-10-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "review the codebase and ensure if it comply to our constitution"

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-10-12
- Q: What is the nature of the "system" that will perform the compliance review? → A: An automated tool that scans the codebase.
- Q: What level of granularity should the reviewer be able to select for "codebase sections"? → A: Entire files or directories.
- Q: How does the system handle principles that are subjective or require human judgment? → A: Flag them for manual review by a human.
- Q: How many constitution files should the system be able to process? → A: Multiple constitution files (e.g., one per module).
- Q: How should the system integrate with existing development workflows for tracking changes and reviews? → A: Integration with Git for tracking changes and pull requests.
- Q: What format should the compliance report be generated in? → A: Structured data format (e.g., JSON, XML) for easy machine readability.
- Q: What are the performance targets for the review process? → A: No specific performance targets are required at this stage.

## Out of Scope

- **OS-001**: Configuration files (e.g., `.yaml`, `.toml`), generated code, and third-party libraries are out of scope for automated compliance review.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Systematically Review Codebase (Priority: P1)
As a developer, I want to systematically review the codebase against the project constitution, so that I can identify areas of non-compliance and propose corrective actions.

**Why this priority**: Ensures code quality, maintainability, and adherence to established standards.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by performing a manual or automated audit of code against constitution principles.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the project codebase and the project constitution, **When** an automated tool performs a review, **Then** a report of compliance status and identified non-compliant areas is generated.
2. **Given** a non-compliant code section, **When** a corrective action is proposed, **Then** the proposal aligns with the constitution's principles.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a code section has multiple interpretations regarding a principle?
- How does the automated tool handle principles that are subjective or require human judgment? It flags them for manual review by a human.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The automated tool MUST enable a reviewer to select entire files or directories of the codebase for compliance review.
- **FR-002**: The automated tool MUST allow the reviewer to select specific constitution principles to apply during the review.
- **FR-003**: The automated tool MUST generate a report detailing compliance status for reviewed code sections against selected principles.
- **FR-004**: The report MUST highlight areas of non-compliance with references to the relevant constitution principles.
- **FR-005**: The automated tool MUST provide a mechanism to record proposed corrective actions for non-compliant areas.
- **FR-006**: The automated tool MUST flag subjective principles or those requiring human judgment for manual review.
- **FR-007**: The automated tool MUST be able to process multiple constitution files (e.g., one per module).
- **FR-008**: The automated tool MUST integrate with Git for tracking changes and pull requests.
- **FR-009**: The compliance report MUST be generated in a structured data format (e.g., JSON, XML) for easy machine readability.

### Key Entities

- **Codebase Section**: Represents an entire file or directory within the project.
- **Constitution Principle**: A specific rule or guideline from the project constitution.
- **Compliance Report**: A document detailing the findings of a compliance review.
- **Corrective Action**: A proposed change to address non-compliance.

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: The compliance review process identifies 90% of all non-compliant code sections against a given set of principles.
- **SC-002**: A compliance report can be generated for any selected codebase section and set of principles in under 5 minutes.
- **SC-003**: Reviewers can easily understand the compliance report and proposed corrective actions, leading to a 20% reduction in time spent on manual code quality checks.
